### Frame size

Frame size the image sensor(usually CMOS) size of a camera, bigger frame size usually result in less noise hence better image quality when ISO is high. But the camera itself is usually larger & less handy to carry around if it's equited with big image sensor.

These are common frame sizes:

- Medium Format: 53x40 (Hasselblad & Fujifilm)
- Full Frame: 36x24mm (Sony, Nikon, Panasonic, Canon & Leica)
- APSC: 23.6x15.6mm (Fujifilm, Richo & Sony)
- M43(Micro Four Thirds): 4/3 aspect ratio, 18x13.5mm. (Olympus & Panasonic)
- 1 inch: 12.8x9.6mm (even some phones are equipted with 1 inch CMOS censor)

### 3 factors of a exposure

1. AP: apture. the max apture of lens. (higher AP -> more light)
2. SS: shutter speed. (slower SS -> more light)
3. ISO: how sensitive the camer sensor(usually CMOS) is to light. (higher ISO -> more light)

Notice:

1. higher AP will increase exposure, but if AP is too high it may hurt image quality/sharpness :(
2. slower SS will increase exposure, but if we were shooting moving targets & SS is not quick enough, we may get blury photos :(
3. higher ISO will increase exposure, but high ISO -> more noise -> lower image quality :(
